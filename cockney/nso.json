Both of these requests are secure and are provided minimal information.\n\nWe are open to any questions regarding the services we use (use `!!devmail`) and you may discontinue this process if you wish to do so.\n\n**__Privacy__**\nNeither we, nor any step other than Nintendo's own website, gain access to your username and password. We receive hash values only (and these do not contain any meaningful information).\nThe only information we save to our databases are the `iksm_session`, `_gtoken`, `_park_session`, and `session_token` cookies which can *only* be generated by Nintendo's own API. This cannot be used as a form of account identification and do not provide any access route to your account outside of the Nintendo Switch Online services that use them.\n\n***For more information, visit the page on our site: https://h3xmani.ac/spyke/nso-information***"
