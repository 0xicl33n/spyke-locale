To get started, fork this repo and copy the text files from the `en` folder to your langauge of choice. Edit them to match the language. Please do not delete any quotation marks and do not edit any line that starts with a `#`. I have three languages in here for now, but feel free to add your own translation for your own language.


Please add your translation for each line under the existing line, because i will forget which line is which and get confused. You do not have to do this with `uni.txt`

To do the block text, please do this

```
