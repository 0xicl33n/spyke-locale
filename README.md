To get started, fork this repo and copy the text files from the `en` folder to your langauge of choice. Edit them to match the language. Please do not delete any quotation marks and do not edit any line that starts with a `#`. I have three languages in here for now, but feel free to add your own translation for your own language.


Please add your translation for each line under the existing line, because i will forget which line is which and get confused. You do not have to do this with `uni.txt`

Create a new file in the `locale` folder called ` profile.lang.yml`

Fill it like this:


`profile.jp.yml`

```yaml
jp:
  profile_help: |
    your shit goes here
  level_help: |
    your shit goes here
    if it is multiline do this
    
    you can also do this
    
  example_help: | 
    you should be able to understand how this works
```
Please keep the file names the same, i do not speak your language :)

To submit your translation, make a pull request
